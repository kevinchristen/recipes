## Ram-don

### Ingredients

* well-marbled sirloin steak (6 to 8 ounces)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 T neutral oil
* 1 packet instant jajangmyeon noodles, such as Nongshim’s Chapagetti
* 1 packet instant jjampong noodles, such as Nongshim’s Neoguri

### Directions
1. Bring 4 cups of water to boil in a medium pot.
2. While waiting for the water to boil, prepare the sirloin: Pat it dry and season on all sides with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is smoking, add the steak and cook for 3 to 5 minutes on both sides. Set aside to rest.
4. Once the water is boiling, add both types of noodles and cook until just-tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
5. Strain the noodles, reserving 1 cup of the starchy water.
6. Return noodles to the pot over low heat and add the Chapagetti seasoning, half of the Neoguri seasoning, and some of the reserved noodle water. Stir until the seasonings are well blended.
7. Thinly slice the steak and add to the noodles. Stir and serve.
