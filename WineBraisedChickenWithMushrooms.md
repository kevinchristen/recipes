# Wine braised chicken with mushrooms

From the [Washington Post Voraciously lead writer Becky Krystal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/06/11/bathed-in-white-wine-and-family-lore-this-one-pan-chicken-with-mushrooms-is-a-braise-for-all-seasons/), with modifications. Total time 1h 30m.

## Ingredients

* 6 bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed. This is the amount that will fit in our 5.5 qt. Le Creuset dutch oven.
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 3T Dijon mustard, plus more as needed
* 1/2c seasoned Italian-style bread crumbs (bread crumbs with Italian seasoning)
* 2T olive oil, plus more as needed
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* Most of a bottle of dry white wine, or more or less as needed depending on the size of the pan
* 16 ounces cremini or white button mushrooms, sliced

## Instructions

1.  Remove skin from chicken and season with salt and pepper. This can be done a day ahead of time.
2.  Position the rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350℉.
3.  Generously coat both sides of the thighs with mustard and then dip in the bread crumbs (a large, shallow plate or pie dish is great for this), one at a time, turning the meat over to ensure it’s evenly covered. Transfer the breaded chicken to a baking sheet or large platter and let it rest for at least 10 minutes to allow the coating to set.
4.  In a Dutch oven over medium heat, heat 2T of the oil until shimmering. Add the breaded chicken skinned side down, all at once or in two batches depending on the size of your pan. Cook until the breading is dark golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Resist the urge to move the chicken too soon to ensure the breading stays put. Flip the pieces over, ideally with a fork, as tongs can dislodge more of the breading. Cook another 3 to 5 minutes, adding more oil as necessary to keep the pan from drying out and the chicken from burning or sticking. Don’t worry if a little of the breading comes off — you can press it back on or leave to help thicken and flavor the braising liquid. Transfer the chicken back to the baking sheet or platter.
5.  If the pan is looking dry, add another glug of oil. Stir in the sliced garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
6.  Add a splash of the wine and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the sliced mushrooms, season with a generous pinch of salt and stir. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just to jump-start the cooking process.
7.  Nestle the chicken pieces, skinned side up, on top of the mushrooms and pour in the rest of the wine around the chicken. The amount you’ll need will vary based on the width of your pan, but make sure it’s enough to cover the mushrooms and just reach the bottom of the chicken.
8.  Cover the pan with a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook for 30 minutes and then remove the lid.
9.  Cook an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, away from a bone, reads 165℉. Dark meat is very forgiving, and will be fine up to as high as 195℉, so don’t fret if you overshoot it a bit.
10.  Serve the chicken warm, with the mushrooms and plenty of juices for dipping.
