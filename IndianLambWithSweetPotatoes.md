From [The World's Healthiest Foods](http://whfoods.org/genpage.php?tname=recipe&dbid=81). Total time 30m.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. ground or minced lamb shoulder or leg
* 2 medium sized onion quartered and sliced thin
* 4 T minced fresh ginger
* 6 medium cloves garlic, pressed
* 2 t garam masala
* 10 cups finely chopped kale
* 6 cups sweet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1 inch cubes (about 2 large potato)
* 2 cup + 2 TBS chicken broth
* Salt and white pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Prepare all the vegetables.
2. Heat 2 T broth in a medium stainless steel large size braising pot or skillet. Healthy Sauté onion, garlic, ginger and lamb in broth over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Add garam masala, mixing well for about half a minute. Add 2 cup broth and stir in sweet potatoes and kale. Simmer on medium low heat covered for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until lamb, potatoes and kale are tender.
4. Season with salt and pepper.

In order to make this recipe quick and easy for you we have cut the vegetables and lamb fairly small. This way they can cook faster and the lamb can become tender more quickly. Make sure the lamb pieces are not bigger than ½ inch, otherwise they won't be tender when the vegetables are done. If you have the time to cook this for a longer time, and want a chunkier appearance cut everything a little bigger and simmer on low for an extra 15-20 minutes, or until tender with a little extra broth. Add the kale during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Make sure you mix in the garam masala well by stirring before adding liquid. This brings out the flavor of the spices.
