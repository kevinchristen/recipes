Modified from [Swasthi's Recipes](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/dal-makhani-recipe/#h-ingredients-substitutes) and [Cook with Manali](https://www.cookwithmanali.com/dal-makhani/). Total time 4h (but can simmer longer), plus overnight soaking.

## Ingredients

* 2 c (1 bag) dried black lentils (urad dal)
* 1 c (0.5 bag) dried kidney beans (rajma)
* 2 T ghee
* 6 T butter divided, use amul butter (salted) if possible
* 2 bay leaf
* 2 whole black cardamom
* 4 whole green cardamom
* 2 finely diced medium white onion
* 2 T minced fresh ginger
* 2 T minced fresh garlic
* 1 c tomato puree
* 1 t kashmiri red chili powder
* 0.5 t garam masala
* 1 t salt or to taste
* 1 t sugar
* 0.5 t kashuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
* 0.5 c cream
* more amul butter (salted) for serving

## Instructions

### Dal and Rajma

1.  Wash and rinse urad dal and rajma in a large bowl. Soak overnight.
1.  Drain and pressure cook with 3.5 c water and salt for 30m. After natural pressure release both should be completely soft; mash them with your fingers to check.
1.  Mash some of the dal and rajma with a potato masher.
1.  Simmer dal and rajma in the instant pot while you make the masala.

### Masala

1.  Heat 2 T butter and 1 T ghee in a large pot.
1.  Saute the bay leaf and cardamom for 30s.
1.  Saute the onion for around 6 to 7 minutes or until it turns light golden brown. Keep stirring it continuously so that it doesn't burn and keep heat on medium.
1.  Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 1-2m until the raw smell goes away.
1.  Add the tomato puree and mix. Cook for 2m or until the puree mixes well with masala and oil starts oozing out from the sides.
1.  Add the dal, rajma, and its water.
1.  Add garam masala, chili powder and salt.
1.  Add 0.5 c water, stir and set heat to low. Let it simmer on low heat uncovered for around 80m. Stir frequently to prevent sticking, and add water as necessary to prevent excessive thickening. Half way through, add sugar and begin tasting for salt and sugar balance.
1.  Add kashuri methi, the remaining 1 T butter, and 1/4 cup cream. Simmer for 10m on low heat. Dal will become really creamy by now.
1.  Garnish dal makhani with more cream and serve with a pat of amul butter. Enjoy!
