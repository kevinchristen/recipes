# Baked Potatoes (English Jacket Potatoes)

From [How to Make English Jacket Potatoes](https://cupofjo.com/2014/08/how-to-make-english-jacket-potatoes/).

1. Preheat oven to 400℉.
2. Cut a cross on the potatoes.
3. Put the potatoes at the top of the oven—straight on the rack, not a
   baking tray, and cook 1-2 hours (usually closer to 2).
4. When they feel crunchy on the outside, pull the rack out, cut the
   potatoes open again to release the steam, then put them back into the
   oven.
5. After ten minutes, serve immediately with shedloads of butter, salt and
   pepper.
