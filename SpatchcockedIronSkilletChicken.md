## Tips

The secret to making this chicken is using an everyday cast iron skillet that you preheat in the oven.

If your whole chicken is frozen, it is best to thaw it in the refrigerator; a 4-pound bird will take about 24 hours so you need to plan ahead. If you didn't remove it from the freezer the night before, you can defrost it in a water bath, but you need to make sure the water stays nice and cold. Place the chicken (still wrapped) in the sink or large container and fill with cold water; change the water every 30 minutes. Thawing takes about 30 minutes for every pound. And although it may seem obvious, there are times this step is overlooked: don't forget to remove the package of giblets from inside the bird once your chicken is thawed.

In order to get the crispiest skin, you need to make sure the chicken is completely dry before adding seasonings and placing in the oven. One way to do this is to remove the wrapping from the chicken the day before and rinse the bird inside and out and pat dry. Then place the chicken in a roasting pan in the refrigerator (without any covering) overnight; this will allow the bird to dry out and eliminate any moisture. (You can do this with turkey as well.)
