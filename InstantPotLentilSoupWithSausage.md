*   1 large red or yellow onion, chopped

*   1 pound hot or sweet Italian sausage (pork, chicken or turkey), casing
    removed
*   6 garlic cloves, chopped
*   1 teaspoon onion powder
*   1 teaspoon garlic powder
*   3 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
*   2 tablespoons fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried oregano
*   Generous pinch of red-pepper flakes
*   3/4 cup dry white wine
*   1 (14-ounce) can whole or chopped tomatoes
*   7-8 cups chicken stock
*   2 cups dried lentils, preferably black beluga
*   1 bay leaf
*   5 ounces delicate leafy greens, such as baby spinach or baby kale, or 8
    ounces hearty greens, such as chard or collards (stemmed and chopped),
    fresh or frozen
*   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
*   Chopped fresh basil, for serving
*   Grated Parmesan, for serving

## Directions

1.  Cover the bottom of a 5- to 8-quart pressure cooker with a thin layer
    of olive oil. Add the onion and season lightly with salt. Using the
    sauté setting, cook until the onion is softened and translucent,
    stirring constantly, about 5 minutes.
2.  Add the sausage. Cook, breaking the sausage into small pieces with a
    spatula or a wooden spoon, until it starts to brown, about 5
    minutes. Add the fresh garlic, onion and garlic powders, thyme,
    oregano, red-pepper flakes and several generous grinds of pepper. Stir
    to combine and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the wine and
    stir, scraping the bottom of the pot to remove any browned bits. Simmer
    until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
3.  Add the tomatoes and their juices (if using whole tomatoes, crush them
    into pieces with your hands as you add them), followed by the chicken
    stock, lentils and bay leaf. Season generously with pepper and stir to
    combine. Cover and set steam valve to sealed position. Cook on high
    pressure for 10 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 5
    minutes, then release the remaining pressure manually.
4.  Open the lid. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Using
    the sauté setting, stir in the greens and cook until wilted and tender,
    2 to 5 minutes, depending on the type of green. Stir in the vinegar and
    season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and top with
    basil and Parmesan.
