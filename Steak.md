# Steak

## Reverse sear

1. Put steak on wire rack over baking sheet in 200-250℉ oven.
2. Cook until internal temperature reaches 110℉. An 8 ounce, 2 inch thick ribeye increases about 1℉ per minute, so about 50 minutes for a steak that's starting at near room temp.
3. Sear on a hot iron skillet, only about 90 sec per side.
4. Serve immediately; no need to rest.
