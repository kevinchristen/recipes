# Prime Rib Roast

From [Washington Post Roasted Prime Rib With Roasted Beef Fat Vinaigrette](https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/roasted-prime-rib-roasted-beef-fat-vinaigrette/15056/?itid=lk_inline_manual_37). 6-6.5 hours. 6 servings.

Rib roasts cut from the chuck, or forward, section of the animal will have the fat cap necessary to render for this recipe's accompanying vinaigrette; ask your butcher to show you the difference between that and a smaller, somewhat leaner rib roast cut from the loin side. The paste recipe here will work for a roast that's up to 12 pounds, without your having to scale up any other ingredients.

## Ingredients

* One 6 or 7 pound boneless rib-eye (prime rib) roast, cut from the chuck end (see headnote)
* 1/2 cup kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling
* 1/4 cup freshly ground black pepper, plus more for sprinkling
* 3/4 cup Dijon-style mustard
* 2 or 3 fresh bay leaves, cut into strips
* 1 head garlic, cut horizontally in half (optional)
* Whipped Buttermilk With Horseradish and Tarragon (see related recipe)
* Coarse salt, for sprinkling

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Season the meat all over with a light, even sprinkling of salt and pepper.
2. Whisk together the mustard, the 1/2 cup of salt and 1/4 cup of pepper in a medium bowl to form a paste. Rub it all over the meat ( a thin layer; you might not use it all), then press the strips of bay leaf along the top of the roast. Transfer to a shallow roasting pan, fat side up. Place the garlic head halves in the pan, if using. Slow-roast for 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours or until the center of the meat registers 120 degrees (medium-rare) to 135 degrees (medium), keeping in mind the temperature will rise as the roast rests. (Check after the first 2 1/2 hours; the temperature of the meat should be about 115 degrees; if not, increase the oven temperature to 300 degrees.)
3. Let it rest for 30 minutes (in its pan) in a warm, draft-free spot. Meanwhile, start the vinaigrette: Combine the shallots, roasted garlic (to taste), red wine vinegar, salt and mustard in a medium bowl; let it macerate for 30 to 40 minutes.
4. When you're just about ready to serve, preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
5. Return the roast to the oven; roast for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown, checking every 5 minutes or so. Transfer the roast to a cutting board to rest. Pour 1 cup of the pan juices/drippings into a heatproof liquid measuring cup; the amount will vary based on the size of your roast. (If for some reason you don't get a full cup, make up the difference with a neutrally flavored oil.)
6. Pour the warm drippings into the shallot mixture, whisking constantly. The vinaigrette might not fully emulsify; that's okay. Add the chopped parsley and rosemary, if using, whisking to incorporate. Taste, and season with pepper as needed.
7. Discard the bay leaf strips atop the roast. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Cut the meat into slices as thick as you'd like. Serve warm, with the vinaigrette, the Whipped Buttermilk With Horseradish and Tarragon and some cloves of the roasted garlic, if desired.

# Whipped Buttermilk With Horseradish and Tarragon

Make Ahead: The condiment can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day; be sure to stir it just before serving. You'll have some left over.
Servings:

Tested size: 6 servings; makes about 1 1/2 cups

## Ingredients

* 6 tablespoons heavy cream
* 6 tablespoons buttermilk or kefir, preferably full-fat
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed

* 3/4 teaspoon finely chopped fresh tarragon
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Combine the heavy cream and buttermilk in the bowl of a stand mixer or handheld mixer; beat on low, then medium-high speed until soft peaks form.
2. Stop to add the salt, horseradish, tarragon and cayenne pepper; beat briefly on medium-high speed to incorporate. Taste, and add salt and/or more horseradish, as you like.
3. Transfer to an airtight container; refrigerate until ready to use (up to 1 day in advance).

## Log
* Thanksgiving 2023: 5.2 lb roast. 4 hours for first stage cooking (after raising temp to 300). Plenty for 4.
*  Thanksgiving 2022: 6.3 lb roast was twice as much as needed for 4 (3 "strings", according to the butcher). 6 hours from start to table.
