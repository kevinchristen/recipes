# Japchae

Korean stir fry with a sweet and savory sauce and glass noodles. 70 minutes total, including 30 minutes prep.

## Ingredients

### Stir fry (exact amounts aren't critical)

* 8 oz shitake mushrooms, sliced
* 16 oz thinly sliced beef, or strips of pork or chicken. Flank steak is my usual choice.
* 2 bell peppers, sliced into strips
* 2 carrots, jullianed
* 1 onion, sliced into strips
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* Vegetable oil

### Sauce

* 3 T soy sauce
* 2 T brown sugar
* 3 T oyster sauce
* 1 t of garlic from above
* 1 t of arrowroot

### Noodles

* Korean sweet potato noodles, aka dangmyeon, glass noodles, cellophane noodles, or vermicelli
* Sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Cook noodles in boiling water and sesame oil, briefly until soft, then drain. Traditionally the noodles are stir fried with other ingredients (added last), but due to pan-size limitations, I usually just serve the other ingredients on a bed of noodles.
2. Stir fry bell peppers and carrots in some oil, then set aside.
3. Stir fry onions, then set aside.
4. Stir fry meat and mushrooms.
5. Add garlic and stir until fragrant.
6. Add stir fried ingredients back, add sauce, and allow to simmer until thickened.

Serve on the noodles. Stir frying separately maintains the colors of the vegetables.
