1h 30m. From [Voraciously](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/03/11/this-spicy-shakshuka-is-all-about-the-sauce/).

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 2 medium yellow onions, finely diced
* 1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded and finely diced
* 1 jalapeño pepper, cored, seeded and sliced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 to 2 tablespoons harissa
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
* 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon ground caraway seed
* 6 to 8 large eggs
* Chopped fresh herbs, such as dill or cilantro, for garnish (optional)
* Crumbled feta, for garnish (optional)
* Challah, pita or crusty bread, for serving

## Instructions
1. In a large skillet (at least 10 inches) over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the bell pepper and jalapeño and cook, stirring occasionally, until just softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, 1 tablespoon harissa and the garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, for an additional 2 minutes.
2. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, salt, sugar, paprika, cumin and caraway. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered until the sauce is thick and shiny, about 20 minutes. It will reduce somewhat, as well. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or the remaining harissa, if you like it spicier.
3. Meanwhile, position the rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400℉.
4. Remove the skillet from the heat. Using a large spoon, create wells in the sauce. Carefully break 1 egg into a cup or ramekin, then slip it into one of the wells; repeat with the remaining eggs. (Cracking the egg into a cup first lets you inspect it for any runaway bits of shell.) Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for about 12 minutes, until the egg whites are just set, but the yolks are still a little runny.
5. Transfer the skillet to the counter and sprinkle with the herbs and feta, if using. Drizzle with more olive oil, to taste. Serve the shakshuka directly from the skillet, with plenty of bread.
