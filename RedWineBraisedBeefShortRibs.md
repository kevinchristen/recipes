Modified from [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/red-wine-braised-shortribs-367736). Total time 3.5h.

## Ingredients

* 4-5 lbs bone-in beef short ribs, cut crosswise into 2" pieces. 7-8 pieces will fit in our 5.5 qt. Le Creuset dutch oven.
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 3T vegetable oil
* 3 medium onions, chopped
* 3 medium carrots, peeled, chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 3T all-purpose flour
* 1T tomato paste
* 1 750-milliliter bottle dry red wine (preferably Cabernet Sauvignon)
* 10 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
* 8 sprigs thyme
* 4 sprigs oregano
* 2 sprigs rosemary
* 2 fresh or dried bay leaves
* 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
* 2-4c beef stock

## Instructions

1.  Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer short ribs to a plate. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from pot.
2.  Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes.
3.  Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until well combined and deep red, 2-3 minutes.
4.  Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated juices. Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes.
5.  Add all herbs to pot along with garlic. Stir in stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven.
6.  Cook until short ribs are tender, 2-2 1/2 hours. Bones should pull out easily. Transfer short ribs to a platter. Strain sauce from pot into a measuring cup. Spoon fat from surface of sauce and discard; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
7.  Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes with sauce spooned over.
