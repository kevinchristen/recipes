Using a slow cooker is one of the easiest ways to get a hearty, healthy meal on the table with very little effort. If it’s a hot summer day and you want to cook a big meal without turning on the oven, a slow cooker is the answer. If the weather is frigid and you’re craving comfort food, pull out the slow cooker. If you’re busy as all get-out and cooking is the last thing you want to do, the solution is – you guessed it – a slow cooker.

Slow-Cooked Coconut Ginger Pork is a recipe that both slow cooker aficionados and newbies will love. A large cut of pork is slow cooked until tender and infused with the spicy, aromatic flavor of ginger, garlic and coconut milk. Salty, savory pork fat drips off the roast as it cooks, swirling with the ginger-scented coconut milk to create an incredibly flavorful broth. When coconut milk cooks for hours it loses its milky quality and looks more like coconut oil. Still, it adds a creamy richness to the broth and seeps into the meat, giving it a slightly sweet flavor.

Unless you’re feeding a large group, meals from a slow cooker typically provide leftovers for days. On the first night, serve the succulent pork and rich broth in bowls filled with raw shredded cabbage or steamed cauliflower rice. The next day, shred the meat over a salad. After that, add the meat to a stir-fry or omelet or eat it cold straight out of the refrigerator. Anyway you serve it, you’re going to love it.

Servings: 6-8

## Ingredients

*   3 to 4 pound boneless pork butt/shoulder roast
*   1 tablespoon ground coriander (original recipe: 1 teaspoon)
*   1 tablespoon ground cumin (original recipe: 1 teaspoon)
*   1 teaspoon salt
*   1 teaspoon black pepper
*   2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
*   4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
*   1 onion, peeled and cut into 8 chunks
*   1/2 can of coconut milk
*   Lime wedges for garnish

## Instructions

1.  Mix together the coriander, cumin, salt and pepper. Use your fingers to rub the seasonings all over the roast.

2.  Place the meat in a slow cooker and surround with onions, garlic, ginger and the half can of coconut milk.

3.  Cover the slow cooker and cook on high for 5 to 6 hours or on low for 8 to 10 hours. Although both cooking temperatures give delicious results, meat cooked on low will be the most tender. The roast will give off moisture and fat while cooking, doubling or tripling the amount of broth by the time the roast is ready.
