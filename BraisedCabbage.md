# Braised Cabbage

My own recipe. 45 min to completion.

## Ingredients

* 4 slices bacon
* 1 head cabbage
* 1 cup stock
* 1 t ground cumin
* 1 t cumin seeds
* 1 t chili powder
* 1 t oregano
* 1/2 t pepper
* 2 T apple cider vinegar
* kosher salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon and reserve fat.
2. Chop bacon and roughly slice cabbage.
3. Braise cabbage in stock in a covered dutch oven until slightly softened, then uncover and continue to cook until most of the stock evaporates. Don't overcook; final product is better when the cabbage isn't soft all the way through.
4. Add remaining ingredients (including bacon fat) and stir while continuing to saute.
5. Taste and adjust.
